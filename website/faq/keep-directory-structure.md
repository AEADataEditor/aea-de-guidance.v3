## Should we keep the data and directory structure as we used it ourselves or should we set up the files in a way that would make replication as straightforward as possible?

> ... the directory structure has gotten a little clunky over the years working on this project...

The Data and Code Availability Policy says:

> "Files uploaded to the AEA Data and Code Repository should retain the file names as originally executed or used, their original file format, and their original "grouping" in terms of directories."

You should feel free to reorganize, but you should ensure when we run the reorganized files, they produce the **same results that are reported in the paper**. Or put differently, the numbers in the paper should be produced by the reorganized files. We are not trying to reproduce your historical path to the paper, only the current state of the paper.

Such restructuring may also be appropriate if you have a very sophisticated reproducible setup in your lab or group. A replicator does not need all sorts of fancy dynamic setup scripts that are very relevant in a lab, but unnecessarily complicate the process for a replicator. You should attempt to simplify the final setup to make it easy for anybody to run this particular project, once.
